      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The Open Meeting Toolkit for the Carolinas builds on the Open Meetings Policy project by Sunshine Request and
        Code for Asheville. Volunteers in Asheville
        attended local government meetings, observed barriers to participation, synthesized their findings, developed a
        policy proposal, gathered support, and
        presented that proposal to their local government. Code for the Carolinas volunteers realized the potential in
        their project to improve access to local
        government statewide and to engage civic technology volunteers with a variety of skills and backgrounds. Code
        for America recognized this scaling project
        as a Summer 2022 Impact Sprint.

        This website provides resources to support a team of volunteers using the Toolkit to improve access to public
        meetings in their North Carolina community.
        Resources include instructions for mapping public meetings, doing an environmental scan of local community
        features that affect public meetings, forms for taking
        structured notes about public meetings (before, during, and after), guidance on synthesizing observations, and
        examples of recommendations.

      <h2>Local Scan</h2>

      <p>
        Start by getting to know some background about public meetings in your community. The Toolkit's local scan
        includes two activities to help you prepare:
        a map of public meetings and an environmental scan, called a STEEPLE analysis.

          <h3>Add Meetings to the Map</h3>
        </summary>
        <p>
          The Public Meetings in North Carolina map is a tool to visualize and learn about public meetings in North
          Carolina.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Adding meetings to the map is a jump-right-in activity that lets any new volunteer contribute to the Open
            Meeting Toolkit project.</li>
          <li>The map can be a compelling visual for outreach to engage new participants. </li>
          <li>The map can be useful to local teams planning to evaluate meetings. </li>
          <li>We can support local teams by helping to complete maps for their communities.</li>
          <li>We could find a partner who commits to host and maintain the map (not very likely).</li>
          <li>Local teams could find partners who commit to hosting and maintaining maps for their county (more likely).
          </li>
          <li>Code for the Carolinas has not committed to completing or maintaining the map.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          To add meetings to the map, provide a comma-separated value (.csv) file containing the fields from the Data
          Dictionary to the Code for the Carolinas team.
          Include as many fields as possible for the meetings in your community, keeping in mind that some information
          may not be available online. You can collect this
          data in any spreadsheet program. Once you have collected the data, export it in .csv format and save it as
          meetings.csv. Provide it to Code for the Carolinas.

          <h3>Complete a STEEPLE Analysis</h3>
        </summary>
        <p>
          The STEEPLE Analysis helps you get to know about your community in ways that will help you identify barriers
          to participating in public meetings. When the project
          team shared this part of the Toolkit with Sunshine Request and Code for Asheville, they said this type of
          up-front analysis would have made their work a lot easier!

        <p>
          The STEEPLE Analysis comes from a tool called the PEST analysis.
          It was developed by Harvard Business Professor Francis J. Aguilar,
          in his 1964 book Scanning the Business Environment. The main idea behind this process is
          to get a general impression of the community where you will be evaluating public meetings.
          We are using a version of the tool from management training firm Professional Academy, which
          asks questions about the Social, Technical, Environmental, Economic, Political, Legal, and
          Ethical characteristics of the local community. The letters have been rearranged to STEEPLE
          so it is easier to remember and also organizes related concepts in a more logical order
          (example: political next to legal).
        </p>

        <!-- Instructions -->
        <details>
          <summary><span>STEEPLE Analysis Instructions:</span></summary>
          <p>Plan to bring your team together for about one hour to complete the STEEPLE Analysis. You will do this
            analysis to help your own local team prepare to evaluate local government meetings.

          <p><strong>Temporary Instructions</strong></p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>These instructions are for teams starting to use the Toolkit at the DemocracyLab Hackathon on
              September 10, 2022.
              We expect revised instructions to be posted by September 30th. Using these temporary instructions, all
              members of the Open Meeting Toolkit Baserow group
              will be able to access your Toolkit data, including STEEPLE Analysis, any contact information you include
              for team members, and meeting evaluations.
              Code for the Carolinas members will only use this information to help you with troubleshooting and to
              improve the Toolkit, such as revising data types.
              We will not analyze your responses or commit to retaining them after December 31, 2022. Keep this in mind
              when deciding what to include in the Toolkit.
              You may want to export your responses and save them locally.</strong>
          </p>

          <p><strong>Prepare Baserow</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>Local Team Leaders should make sure that you and/ or at least one member of your team has a <a
                href="https://baserow.io/" target="_blank">Baserow</a> account and is a member of the Open Meeting
              Toolkit group. A member of Code for the Carolinas can use your email address to add you to the group and
              invite you to Baserow.
              Baserow is free, open source software.
            </li>
            <li>Locate the Open Meeting Toolkit database in the sidebar on left side of the screen and <a

          <br>
          <p><strong>Fill in STEEPLE Analysis Questions</strong></p>
          <p>Decide how your team wants to work on the STEEPLE Analysis. Here are two things to consider:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Does your team know each other? Lead a round of synchronous or asynchronous introductions to get
              acquainted before you start work on the STEEPLE analysis.
            </li>
            <li>
              How will you collaborate? You may choose to collaborate in a breakout room, in chat,
              <a href="https://etherpad.org/" target="_blank">in an Etherpad</a>, or using some other method
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>The STEEPLE analysis has seven parts. Plan to spend no more than about 10 minutes on each part. You can
            always go back and adjust your responses in Baserow. You will have a text box on the last page of the survey
            (Ethical) where you can include any additional information or clarify your answers.</p>
          <!--To complete the whole form as a team (This is the only option we will recommend at the Hackathon. Commenting out the other option.): -->
          <ol>
            <li>Choose one person to take notes on your team's work.</li>
            <li>From the STEEPLE Analysis table in your database, click on the STEEPLE Social form.
              <p>

              form, you can change your responses directly in the STEEPLE Analysis table in Baserow. You can also use
              the link to generate a new, blank form and complete only the pages you want to change.</li>

            target="_blank">Open Meetings Policy</a>:</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>The ever-changing processes for public comment makes it unclear how the public can participate in public
            comment, and difficult to know what to expect from the process.</li>
          <li>Public comment and other opportunities for feedback are not provided at every meeting - there should be
            consistent, ongoing opportunities for public input.</li>
          <li>Public comment is not allowed for all agenda items, and the criteria under which comment is allowed varies
            between public bodies. </li>
          <li>The current public comment process requires a burdensome advance sign-up process that requires disclosure
            of unnecessary personal information.</li>
          <li>Due to technical or process issues, residents have been disconnected or skipped during public comment
            periods. We lack a fair process to ensure these residents are provided an opportunity to participate.</li>
          <li>Meeting materials are not posted online in advance of meetings on a clear, consistent schedule. Meeting
            minutes are not consistently posted in a timely manner after meetings.</li>
          <li>Meeting materials do not contain a clear indication of updates or modifications to documents that were
            posted previously.</li>
          <li>Local government entities publish meeting information on a variety of platforms and websites, making it
            difficult to know which source of information is the official (and most up-to-date) source of information.
            This creates additional work for staff and board members as any updates need to be posted in multiple
            locations.</li>
          <li>Basic board information, such as membership, contact information, meeting schedules, and bylaws are not
            posted or updated consistently for all public bodies.</li>
          <li>Local government entities lack data-driven metrics of public participation, such as
            the number of comments or the methods under which they were provided. As a result, it is
            challenging for staff, elected officials, or the public to analyze how changes to the public
            meeting process increase or decrease public participation.</li>
          <li>Due to a lack of consistency in the process for public participation, it can be
            difficult to evaluate public support or opposition to measures considered by public bodies.</li>

          Complete the During Meeting form as soon as
          possible after the meeting. Complete the After Meeting form one week after the meeting, to allow time for
          meeting information, such as recordings

<h4>Web Accessibility Evaluation</h4>
<br>            
            The Open Meeting Toolkit helps you focus on identifying barriers to participation, especially barriers that exclude people who are frequently left out of local government decisions. The questions in this section have been developed to help you learn about assistive technologies and tools to identify website accessibility problems. These questions help you center empathy for people who use these websites and give you practical tools that you may find helpful in your own work. 
            <br>
            <br> 
            When answering these questions, consider all of the web pages where you found information for the previous questions. Be sure to allow enough time to familiarize yourself with the resources at the links in the questions, especially for your first Before-Meeting evaluation. You may also find it helpful to use the free <a href="https://www.deque.com/axe/browser-extensions/">Axe Browser Extension for Accessibility Testing</a> or a similar automated tool to review the web page.

      <h2>Recommendations</h2>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Temporary Instructions:</strong></p>
      <p><mark>Instructions for analysis and a more complete Recommendations section will be provided by October
          30th.</mark>
        <br>
      </p>
      <br>
      <strong></strong>
      <p> As you decide what changes to recommend, here are two approaches to consider: <strong>Policy</strong> & <strong>Partnerships</strong>. </p>
      <h2>Policy</h2>
      <p> As you consider policy recommendations, review the political and legal sections of your STEEPLE Analysis. Look
        at what local policies exist for
        public meetings and for changing or amending those policies. Keep in mind that local policies can create
        additional requirements for local
        governments but must still meet all requirements of state law. Some questions to consider:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What actions can you take if a current policy is not being followed in practice?</li>
        <li>What is the process to propose changes to current policy?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Sunshine Request and Code for Asheville created a policy proposal called the <a
          href="https://https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQDj9Ey7xh52bENqU2oYct6AQxLd8hJv-bY0B_9ZvCajC4cfFCdnQ_2_4QRHWxeEFgf7LkuHkMfg6Ed/pub"
          target="_blank">Open Meetings Policy</a>
        and presented it to the Governance Committee of Asheville City Council. They also prepared a <a
          href="https://openmeetingspolicy.com" target="_blank">petition</a> and gathered support from organizations and
        individuals. Your team may want to use these as models.
      </p>
      <h2>Partnerships</h2>
      <p>
        Your team may also want to consider partnerships as a way to make it easier to participate in local government,
        especially by making information easier to access. We provide a few
        examples here. Think carefully before making an ongoing commitment for your team to provide this information. It
        may be better for you to partner with a local non-profit
        that will host the information on an ongoing basis. Your team might be most effective by engaging civic
        technology volunteers to help the non-profit prepare their site, rather
        than trying to start a new organization.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <a href="https://councildataproject.org/" target="_blank">Council Data Project</a> provides a model for
          hosting recordings of local government meetings.</li>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>What is a public meeting?</h3>
      <p>We use the term public meeting to refer to local government meetings that are required by law (<a
          href="https://www.ncleg.net/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/ByArticle/Chapter_143/Article_33C.pdf"
          target="_blank">"NC General Statute Chapter 143 33C"</a>) to allow the public to
        attend and, in some cases, to provide public comment. From the statute: "public body" means any elected or
        appointed authority, board, commission, committee, council,
        or other body of the State, or of one or more counties, cities, school administrative units, constituent
        institutions of The University of North Carolina, or other political
        subdivisions or public corporations in the State that (i) is composed of two or more members and (ii) exercises
        or is authorized to exercise a legislative, policy-making,
        quasi-judicial, administrative, or advisory function." There are a few additional considerations, so if you are
        in doubt, please consult the statute.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Can I use the Open Meeting Toolkit for the Carolinas in other places besides North Carolina?</h3>
      <p>There is some interest in adapting the Toolkit for use in other places. Right now, it provides resources for
        North Carolina.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Can a team use the Open Meeting Toolkit without a team leader?</h3>
      <p>Yes, the Toolkit can be used by self-directed teams who share responsibility for leadership.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>What if I notice a technical problem or want to suggest an improvement?</h3>
      <p>The Toolkit is being developed by civic technology volunteers. If you are a civic technology volunteer yourself
        and know how to fix the problem, we
        invite you to <a href="https://github.com/Code-for-the-Carolinas/openmeetingtoolkit" target="_blank">collaborate
          with us on GitHub</a>. You are also welcome
        to contact Code for the Carolinas by email: info at codeforthecarolinas dot org.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Is the Toolkit suitable for research?</h3>
      <p>No, the Toolkit provides a structure and resources for local teams to make observations to help inform
        improvements to public meetings in
        their own communities. Findings from the Toolkit are not intended for publication or as contributions to general
        knowledge. Use of the Toolkit may
        involve recording some public information about public officials, but in general the Toolkit is for recording
        information about public meetings, not about people.</p>
