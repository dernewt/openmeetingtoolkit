# Problem
In practice, residents face barriers to attending and participating in local government meetings, even when they have the legal right to do so. Put yourself in the position of someone who needs to request time off work to attend a public meeting. Would you know far enough in advance when the issue that concerns you will be on the agenda? If you rely on public transportation, can you attend a Planning Board meeting at 7pm? Did the online responses to COVID make it easier for you to participate, or create new technological barriers? These challenges and many more mean that even when North Carolina's open meetings law gives "the general public a right to attend official meetings of public bodies," that right is not always realized in practice.

# Solution
In preparation for the Hackathon, Code for the Carolinas is developing an Open Meeting Toolkit that will allow teams of volunteers to evaluate their local governmentâ€™s public meetings and to make recommendations. At the Hackathon, local teams will launch a Meeting Marathon, to run through the end of 2022.  In the Meeting Marathon, individuals or teams commit to attend and evaluate 5K, 10K, or 26 public meetings. During the Hackathon, local teams will complete an environmental scan of their communities. Code for the Carolinas and other Hackathon volunteers will support these local teams. This project will scale the impact of the Open Meetings Policy by partners Code for Asheville and Sunshine request by extending their work throughout North Carolina.

# Action
- Add public meeting information to state map in a jump-right-in, hands on activity that may involve internet searches or adapting simple scripts. 
- Complete environmental scan STEEPLE analysis for local communities. 
- Local teams commit to a schedule of 5, 10, or 26 public meetings to attend and evaluate by the end of 2022. 
- Learn how to use Toolkit to evaluate meetings, analyze results, and develop recommendations. 
- Offer feedback on usability of Toolkit.
